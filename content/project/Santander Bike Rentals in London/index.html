<p>We can easily create a facet grid that plots bikes hired by month and year.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(scales)
facet_monthly_bike_rentals &lt;- bike %&gt;%
  filter(year &gt;= 2015)%&gt;%
  ggplot(aes(x = bikes_hired))+
    geom_density()+
    facet_grid(vars(year), vars(month))+
  
    scale_x_continuous(labels = number_format(scale = 1/1000, suffix = &quot;K&quot;))+
  
    theme(axis.text.y = element_blank(), plot.background = element_blank(), panel.background = element_blank(), panel.grid = element_line(color = &quot;lightgrey&quot;), strip.background = element_blank())+
  
    labs(title = &quot;Distribution of bikes hired per month&quot;, x = &quot;Bike Rentals&quot;)

<p>Look at May and Jun and compare 2020 with the previous years. What’s happening?</p>
<p><em>It is observable, that the distribution of bike rentals in May and June tends to be more concentrated and centralised around 40,000 daily bike rentals than in many of the other months. This might be due to the fact that temperatures and the overall weather is more stable in these months, and thus there is less fluctuation in daily demand.</em>
<em>Looking at the overall distribution of bike rentals in 2020 compared to the previous years, the first two months seem similar. However, starting from March, a shift in distribution towards the left, can be seen, indicating that bike rentals incurred a period of less demand. This can likely be attributed to the outbreak of the COVID19 pandemic, and people staying home more frequently. This trend continues until the month of June, from which bike rentals follow the previous years’ distributions more closely once again.</em></p>

<p><em>It makes sense to use the mean for calculating expected rentals, as we really need to take very low and very high numbers into consideration. If one were to use the median, and thereby ignore outlying values, the supply might not be well prepared for keeping up with demand on specific days.</em></p>
