summary: The paper develops a general framework categorizing key determinants of positive abnormal stock returns following a firm's issuance of green bonds and moreover aims at synthesizing opposing academic findings. Furthermore, this paper contributes to society by providing explicitly stated policy recommendations to overseeing bodies which can be capitalized on by potential issuers of green bonds. Likewise, these recommendations aid in providing an evident degree of transparency and certainty to outside stakeholders.
